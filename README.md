<b>Simple login and registration package using PHP.</b><br>
This is a simple login and ragistration package created in PHP. I have used PHP Password hashing technique which is considered most secured nowadays. And I have kept the code as simple as possible.

# Installation
→ First of all keep all this files in your web server directory.<br>
→ Import the database file 'testdb.sql' into your database.<br>
→ This will be fully functional on live web server or any web server with preinstalled mail server. In localhost without preinstalled mail server this package can't work properly.<br>
